History
-------
This started as an idea to create a [bot](https://twitter.com/MolotovBot)\n
that would act as a "superhero" and throw an electronic molotov (that is\n
a tweet :P) when called. It was called through the simple *Attack @user \n
@molotovBot*. It has quite a few bugs and you more than welcome to fix them.\n 
You can use it as you wish. You can contact me here for bugs etc but you can\n
patch them yourself as well.

Shoutouts
---------
To [giopso](https://twitter.com/giopso) for the initial idea.
